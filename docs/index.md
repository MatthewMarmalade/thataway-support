# Thataway Support

## Introduction
Thataway is a navigation tool inspired by videogame minimaps that focuses on telling you the direction your destination is in. You can keep track of multiple locations such as home base, faraway friends, and parked cars. Ideal for wandering journeys where all you need to know is if you're headed the right way.

Features:
- Compass-style main screen showing local area, heading, longitude, latitude, and the direction to all active waypoints
- Waypoints differentiated by editable colors and visually ranked by distance
- Close waypoints appear on the minimap for more precise navigation
- New waypoints can be added where you are, or with a searchable map
- List view shows distances to waypoints and toggles individual waypoint visibility on the main screen
- Name, Color, and Location of waypoints can be edited after creation
- No data transmitted off-device
